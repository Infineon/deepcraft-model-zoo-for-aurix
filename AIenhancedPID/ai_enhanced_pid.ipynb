    "## AI Enhanced PID Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller refining the execution of the planned trajectory. Controller in that case is \"enhanced\" by simple MLP network, which is tuning the controller in real time, i.e., it modifies the PID gains. This approach enables achieving higher driving comfort and adaptability to unseen scenarios as opposed to the conventional controller with constant parameters. The PID Controller has been implemented in Simulink and converted into binary FMU model. Then, we are making use of FMPy library enabling model loading and execution. The results of model execution are plotted in separate graphs, i.e., we are plotting P, I, D coefficients and steering angles for both controller variants. Plots include also cross-track error (CTE), which is a setpoint for the controller.\n",
